Hey folks! It's been a long time, but as usual we had to get everything just exactly perfect, and you just can't rush that. We are very happy to announce the availability of the new Slackware 15.0 stable release. There have been way too many changes to even begin to cover them here, but for our dedicated user base suffice to say that you'll find things modern but also familiar. We've gone with the 5.15.19 Linux kernel (part of the 5.15.x kernel series that will be getting long-term support from the kernel developers). You'll also enjoy a refreshed desktop experience including the KDE Plasma 25th Anniversary Edition with support for Wayland sessions.
For additional information, see the official announcement and the release notes. For a complete list of included packages, see the package list.

Build scripts for all kinds of additional software for Slackware 15.0 can be found on the slackbuilds.org website.

Thanks to the Slackware team for all the hard work on getting Slackware 15.0 ready. And of course, thanks to all the open source developers upstream, and to the Slackware community on linuxquestions.org for all the help with bug reports, suggestions, and patches. We couldn't have done it without you.

Enjoy the new stable release!

Pat and the Slackware crew
