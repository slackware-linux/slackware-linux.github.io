The pressure of delivering the Slackware web site - especially at release time - has been an issue for some time.

[Akamai](http://www.akamai.com/) - the leading global Content Delivery Network - have generously provided us with extensive global content caching and Internet routing performance enhancements, allowing us to keep the site up, even at peak times.

A big thanks to the guys at Akamai for making this happen.
