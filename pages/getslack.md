### Get your Slackware ISOs - Torrent
---

Please keep your finished torrent session running as long as possible! We need your help! BitTorrent depends on sharing bandwidth and does not work if there are no seeds (downloaders keeping their client open when download is complete).

You can help by re-starting a finished torrent download in order to share your bandwidth and allow others to download faster! For example: When you're going to bed or away for the weekend, start downloading an already finished torrent. The torrent will perform a quick consistency check and then offer your upload bandwidth to the download pool. Feel free to take these now, but consider supporting the project with a visit to store.slackware.com. Thanks for helping to keep Slackware up and running! :-)
