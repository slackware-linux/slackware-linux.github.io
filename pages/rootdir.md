### Directory

---

**/bin**    Basic user-related programs are here. Command shells and programs such as ls.

**/boot**   LILO boot-related files

**/dev**    Block and character device files.

**/etc**    Configuration and system initialization files.

**/home**   User home directories, except root.

**/lib**    Essential libraries (like the system C library and kernel modules).

**/mnt**    Generic mountpoint for fixing filesystems.

**/opt**    Optional software packages. Slackware installs KDE to this location.

**/proc**   Proc filesystem mountpoint for kernel interaction.

**/root**   Root's home directory.

**/sbin**   System binaries. Programs run by root or at boot time.

**/tmp**    Temporary directory. Everyone has read+write permissions here.

**/usr**    User-related programs such as X11, netscape, and pine.

**/var**    System log files, lock files, mail spools, and printer spools.

In addition to these basic directories, there may be some others. For example, you may have a **/mnt/cdrom** directory for mounting your CD-ROM drive or **/mnt/floppy** for mounting a floppy diskette.
